# bot-11 for ROBOCODE*

(Info on ROBOCODE, URL: http://robocode.sourceforge.net)

Group project to develop a tank bot, and then a groupbot that can be used in group battles.

## Features of bot:
- Anti-gravity movement (from enemy tanks, walls, and friendly bullets!)
- Circular targeting
- Communication between bots (of same team) : share enemy info, leader id, fired bullets
- and other strategies.

*This repo is a public version of my private repo, which was actually used during development, and is quite a mess.
